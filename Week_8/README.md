# Week 8: Project Management and Testing

This week's lesson is less technical than the rest of the course and our motivation is to get y'all familiar with the less arguably less sexy part of software engineering: project management, debugging, and testing. We will kick off the discussion with project management and how projects are generally ran in tech (Agile Methodology). We then brush up upon our git knowledge by discussing how pull requests and code-reviews function. Finally, we discuss test-driven development and the importance of writing tests for your code.
