# Week 4: React

This week, we continue our progress in frontend web development with React. React is a powerful and relatively lightweight framework used to rapidly build out HTML,CSS, and Javascript user interfaces. Although it is widely used, it often has a steep learning curve which is why we're dedicating the next two weeks to flesh out the topic. Additionally, we will also briefly touch upon NodeJS and its package manager `npm` since its involved when developing React.

# Debugging Session

The following are some examples of common mistakes made for the useEffect and useState React hooks. See if you can spot the bugs, why they occur, and any potential solutions :)

# Demo: Setting up React and create-react-app

Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application from the terminal.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine - install it from https://nodejs.org/en/ if you don't already have it installed.

Then, run:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

# Homework

For homework this week, we are going to be recreating the weather app from last week, but in React! [Here](https://www.figma.com/file/vKRFWIFsJ5WRJTvMNFXOiZ/Weather-App?node-id=2%3A213) is the figma for reference.

## Some Tips

- use `create-react-app` in order to get started with development
- Separate parts of the web page into smaller, manageable components (such as a Weather Card)
- Be sure to use React hooks learned in lectures
  - useState to manage state, for variables, etc.
  - useEffect to change variables when a desired state changes
- Once the components and functionality of the site are complete, use CSS to style
- Fetch remains relatively unchanged from JS, and you will probably need to set state within the promise
